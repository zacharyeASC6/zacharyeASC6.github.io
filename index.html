        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! I am an aspiring game designer with a deep interest in game design and games in general. I have a deep passion for coding games and designing mechanics to make games as awesome as they can be! I was born on June 29, 2003 in Brooklyn. I was always naturally good at school, so I didn't really have to try, but the experiences I've had combined with the people I've encountered have more than prepared me for when the time comes for me to struggle to succeed. When I was younger, I never really knew wht I wanted to be when I grew up (which was a question I was asked a lot) because I only knew about the common jobs (doctor, fireman, astronaut, etc). But as the years passed and as I learned more and more about the world around me, I realized that there were jobs in the technology field, mainly the gaming field because I was really big on games when I was younger and I still am now. After looking into it further, I decided that I wanted to become a game designer, and I participated in programming programs (haha) like iDTech, All Star Code, and the Coding League at my school. These experiences have left me with a lot of coding expertise that I can use to pursue my dream and be a great game designer.</p>
